# Script Name: config.ini
# Description: Centralized configuration file for the C2 DFIR toolset.
#              This file securely stores API keys for Threat Intelligence (CTI)
#              enrichment and defines standard file paths for the triage pipeline.
#              Keeping API keys here prevents them from being hardcoded into
#              scripts, reducing the risk of accidental exposure in version control.
# Integration: Designed to support c2_beacon_hunter v2.7 outputs.
