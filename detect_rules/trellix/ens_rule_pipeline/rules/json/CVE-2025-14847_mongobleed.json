Characteristic of CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) exploitation PoCs that flood the server with malformed zlib-compressed requests (often 50k+ connections/min). ENS Firewall cannot enforce per-minute thresholds natively — use as a trigger for correlation with network logs. Strongly recommend excluding known legitimate high-connection sources (application servers, monitoring tools) via source IP/application filters to reduce FPs."
