### MongoBleed (CVE-2025-14847) Information Leak
---

A high-severity vulnerability nicknamed MongoBleed (CVE-2025-14847) allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely leak sensitive memory from vulnerable MongoDB servers. This flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, making it critical for organizations with self-hosted instances to take immediate action.

Exploitation of MongoBleed can be detected by identifying distinct behavioral anomalies in server logs. Unlike legitimate connections, the exploit generates massive connection bursts (50,000-100,000 per minute) from a single source IP and fails to send client metadata (event ID 51800), providing a high-fidelity method for creating detections. An open-source log analysis tool is now available to help defenders scan for these specific indicators of compromise.

### Actionable Threat Data
---

Exploitation involves sending a malformed, compressed network packet that causes the server to return uninitialized heap memory before authentication is performed.

Detection efforts should focus on monitoring MongoDB logs for an unusually high number of rapid connections and disconnections from a single IP address that lack corresponding client metadata (event ID 51800).

Look for CPU and memory spikes correlated with large data requests from an unauthenticated IP address. Enabling verbose command logging may reveal BSON parsing errors associated with exploit attempts.

Affected MongoDB server versions include 8.2.0-8.2.2, 8.0.0-8.0.16, 7.0.0-7.0.27, 6.0.0-6.0.26, 5.0.0-5.0.31, 4.4.0-4.4.29, and all end-of-life versions (4.2, 4.0, 3.6).

As a temporary mitigation if patching is not possible, disable zlib compression by explicitly omitting "zlib" from the networkMessageCompressors or net.compression.compressors server configuration.

### MongoBleed High Connection Rate
---

```sql
event.type = "Network"
AND event.network.direction = "inbound"
AND dst.port.number = 27017
AND tgt.process.name matches "mongod(\\\\.exe)?"
| group connections=count(), total_bytes_in=sum(event.network.bytesIn) by src.ip.address, endpoint.name, tgt.process.name
| filter connections > 50 AND (total_bytes_in / connections) < 1024
```

### MongoBleed Missing Client Metadata
---

```sql
event.product = "mongodb" AND (event.log.message contains "connection" OR event.log.id = 51800)
| let is_accepted = contains(event.log.message, "connection accepted"), is_ended = contains(event.log.message, "end connection"), is_metadata = event.log.id = 51800
| group accepted_flag = sum(is_accepted ? 1 : 0), ended_flag = sum(is_ended ? 1 : 0), metadata_flag = sum(is_metadata ? 1 : 0), remoteIp = first(event.mongodb.remoteIp) by connId = event.mongodb.connectionId
| filter accepted_flag > 0 AND ended_flag > 0 AND metadata_flag = 0
| group suspicious_connections = count() by remoteIp
| filter suspicious_connections > 10
```

### MongoBleed Vulnerable Configuration
---

```sql
event.type = "Process Creation" AND src.process.name matches "mongod(\\\\.exe)?" AND src.process.cmdline contains "zlib" AND (src.process.cmdline contains "networkMessageCompressors" OR src.process.cmdline contains "net.compression.compressors")
```
