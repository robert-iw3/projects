### AI-Themed Black Hat SEO Campaign Distributes Malware
---

Threat actors are leveraging Black Hat SEO techniques to poison search engine results for AI-related keywords, redirecting unsuspecting users to malicious websites that distribute Vidar, Lumma, and Legion Loader malware. These campaigns utilize sophisticated multi-stage redirection chains, browser fingerprinting, and large installer files to evade detection and deliver various information-stealing and cryptocurrency-stealing payloads.


Recent intelligence indicates a resurgence and evolution of Lumma Stealer, with new campaigns employing fake CAPTCHAs, malvertising, and GitHub abuse for distribution, alongside advanced evasion techniques like AMSI bypass and dynamic password retrieval for archives. Additionally, Legion Loader has been observed using legitimate VMware-signed applications for DLL sideloading and a new custom algorithm for shellcode deobfuscation, further enhancing its stealth and persistence.

### Actionable Threat Data
---

Monitor for web traffic to newly registered or suspicious domains, especially those impersonating popular AI tools, and analyze redirection chains for unusual patterns or multiple redirects.

Implement detection rules for JavaScript that performs extensive browser fingerprinting (e.g., collecting browser version, window resolution, cookies, user agent, epoch time of click, referrer, and duration from page load) and encrypts this data using XOR with a randomly generated 5-byte key before sending it in a GET request.

Create alerts for the download and execution of unusually large (e.g., >800MB) password-protected ZIP archives containing NSIS installers, particularly if the password is provided on the download page.

Detect the execution of tasklist.exe and findstr.exe by NSIS installers, especially when used to identify and terminate antivirus processes such as opssvc (Quick Heal), wrsa (Webroot), SophosHealth (Sophos), bdservicehost (BitDefender), AvastUI (Avast), AVGUI (AVG), nsWscSvc (Norton Security), and ekrn (ESET).

Monitor for the execution of MSI files that install themselves in the AppData directory and deploy decoy software, particularly if they perform custom actions involving DLL sideloading (e.g., using 7z.exe to decompress archives with C2-retrieved passwords) and process hollowing into explorer.exe.
