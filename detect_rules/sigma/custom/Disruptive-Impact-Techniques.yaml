title: Disruptive Impact Techniques in Cloud Environments
id: 7e17a1fd-9d96-4d02-81c0-de7b686a93c4
status: experimental
description: Identifies disruptive impact techniques such as the deletion of backups, snapshots, critical resources (VMs, volumes), or user accounts. This behavior is indicative of an adversary attempting to cause damage, destroy data (T1485), or remove access, as highlighted in threat intelligence.

  condition: 1 of them
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate decommissioning of cloud resources by administrators or automated scripts (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
  - Cleanup of development or test environments.
  - Events like object/blob deletion are common and should be correlated or have thresholds applied in the SIEM to detect mass deletion, rather than alerting on single events.
  - It is highly recommended to scope this detection to production environments and filter out known service principals used for infrastructure-as-code.
