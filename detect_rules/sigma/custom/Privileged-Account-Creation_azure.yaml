id: e5336cd9-8397-4745-a1b8-3caed9f28a60
status: experimental
description: Detects the creation of a new user, the addition of a user to a privileged group, or the registration of a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method. Adversaries may perform these actions to create persistent access, either by creating new privileged accounts or by adding their own authentication methods to a compromised account.

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate creation of new administrative users by IT staff.
  - Standard user provisioning workflows that add users to administrative groups.
  - Users legitimately setting up or updating their MFA devices.
  - Correlation with other suspicious activities (e.g., logon from a new location) is highly recommended to increase fidelity.
