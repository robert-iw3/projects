title: Hacktivist TTPs Targeting ICS/OT Systems
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects TTPs associated with hacktivist groups like CARR and KillNet targeting ICS/OT environments.
  It identifies potential DDoS symptoms, anomalous administrative tool usage on critical OT assets
  (HMIs, EWS), and large-scale data exfiltration. These activities can indicate attempts to manipulate
  SCADA systems or serve as a distraction for other malicious actions.

  # Pattern 2: Host-level symptoms of a DDoS or network flood attack.
  # This is a conceptual detection that identifies any inbound connection from the public internet.
  # The SIEM must be configured to aggregate these events and alert when a host receives connections
  # from a high number of distinct source IPs over a short time period (e.g., >200 IPs in 5 minutes).

  condition: manipulation or (ddos_symptom and not filter_ddos_is_internal) or (data_leak and not filter_leak_is_internal)
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrative activity on OT assets. Whitelisting of known tools, parent processes, and administrative users is required for the 'manipulation' pattern.
  - The DDoS and data leak patterns are broad and rely heavily on SIEM-side aggregation and tuning. Without proper baselining and thresholding, they will be very noisy.
  - It is critical to define and filter for your specific OT assets (e.g., by hostname, subnet, or asset inventory tag) to make this detection effective.
