title: OT Network Baseline Deviation
status: experimental
description: >-
  This rule serves as a template for detecting baseline deviations in an OT network.
  It is designed to be implemented in a SIEM that can maintain a stateful baseline of
  known devices and their communication patterns (e.g., IP-port pairs).
  An alert should be generated when: 1) A new device (IP address) appears within the
  defined OT network segments that has not been seen in a historical baseline period
  (e.g., last 14 days). 2) A known OT device communicates on a new port that it has
  not used in the baseline period.
  This can indicate unauthorized device additions, lateral movement, or reconnaissance.

  # This section defines the scope of traffic to be baselined by a stateful SIEM rule.
  # It should be customized with your specific OT network IP ranges.

    source.ip|cidr:
      - '10.100.0.0/16'   # Placeholder for OT network segment 1
      - '192.168.50.0/24' # Placeholder for OT network segment 2

      - '192.168.50.0/24' # Placeholder for OT network segment 2
  # The condition captures any traffic that involves the OT network.
  # The SIEM implementation should use this scope to baseline activity and alert on deviations.
  condition: 1 of them
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate addition of new devices to the OT network.
  - Planned configuration changes or software updates that alter communication patterns (e.g., using new ports).
  - Dynamic port usage by some legitimate applications.
  - These events require an operational process to investigate, validate, and update the baseline to prevent recurring alerts for known-good activity.
