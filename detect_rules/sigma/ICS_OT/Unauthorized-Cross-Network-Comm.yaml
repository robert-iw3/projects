title: Unauthorized IT to OT Network Communication
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects network traffic originating from a defined IT network segment and destined for a protected OT network segment.
  This could indicate a network segmentation breach, unauthorized access attempts, or lateral movement from the IT environment into the OT environment.
  This rule requires tuning by defining the specific IP ranges for your IT and OT networks.

falsepositives:
  - Authorized communication from systems like data historians, HMIs, or engineering workstations that are designed to bridge IT and OT networks. These should be added to the 'filter_known_good' section.
  - Misconfiguration of the IT/OT network IP ranges in the rule.
  - Network scanning from authorized vulnerability management tools. The source IP of the scanner should be added to the filter.
