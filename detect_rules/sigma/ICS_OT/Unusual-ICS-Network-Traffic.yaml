title: Unusual Network Traffic to ICS/OT Environment
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects network traffic originating from the internet or internal corporate IT segments targeting critical ICS/OT subnets.
  This aligns with modern frameworks like MOSAICS (More Situational Awareness for Industrial Control Systems) which emphasize
  the need for continuous network monitoring. Such traffic is often indicative of unauthorized access attempts, lateral movement,
  or external reconnaissance against sensitive industrial control systems, such as those found in maritime or other critical
  infrastructure. Legitimate traffic to these zones should be strictly controlled and originate only from authorized jump hosts or management servers.

  # These placeholders MUST be customized for your environment.
  # The effectiveness of this rule is entirely dependent on accurate network segmentation definitions.
  # Example: '10.200.0.0/16' for OT, '192.168.0.0/16' for IT.
  selection_external:
    DestinationIp|re: '^<CRITICAL_ICS_SUBNETS>$' # Placeholder for critical OT/ICS subnets (e.g., navigation, propulsion, safety systems).
    SourceIp|private_address: false
  selection_internal:
    DestinationIp|re: '^<CRITICAL_ICS_SUBNETS>$' # Placeholder for critical OT/ICS subnets.
    SourceIp|re: '^<IT_CORPORATE_SUBNETS>$' # Placeholder for general corporate IT subnets that should not directly access OT.
  # This filter should contain all authorized sources that are allowed to communicate with the OT network.
  filter_known_good:
    SourceIp:
      - '<AUTHORIZED_JUMP_HOSTS>' # Placeholder for IP addresses of jump hosts or bastion servers.
      - '<AUTHORIZED_MANAGEMENT_SERVERS>' # Placeholder for patch management, AV, or other admin servers.
      - '<AUTHORIZED_VENDOR_VPNS>' # Placeholder for IP ranges used by vendors for remote support.
      - '<VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_IP>' # Placeholder for vulnerability scanner IPs.
  condition: (selection_external or selection_internal) and not filter_known_good
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrative or vendor access from an IP address not included in the 'filter_known_good' exclusion list.
  - Misconfiguration of the network subnet placeholders (ICS_SUBNETS, IT_CORPORATE_SUBNETS).
  - Network traffic from authorized vulnerability scanners.
