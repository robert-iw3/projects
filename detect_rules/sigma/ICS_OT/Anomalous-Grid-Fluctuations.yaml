title: Anomalous Grid Fluctuations Indicating Potential Manipulation
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects anomalous voltage or frequency fluctuations in an ICS/OT environment, which could be an early indicator of a cyber-physical attack or system instability.
  As highlighted in analyses of real-world grid events, abnormal voltage levels and oscillations often precede major outages and can be a symptom of control system manipulation (e.g., by modifying setpoints or controller logic).
  This detection requires logs from process historians or other OT monitoring systems that record physical process values.

  condition: 1 of them
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate grid instability caused by non-malicious events (e.g., physical equipment failure, weather events, sudden changes in load or generation).
  - Normal, short-lived fluctuations during system startup, shutdown, or switching operations.
  - Incorrectly configured thresholds that do not match the system's normal operating parameters.
