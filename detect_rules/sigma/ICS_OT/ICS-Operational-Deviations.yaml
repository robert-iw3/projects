title: Malicious Stoppage of ICS/OT Processes
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects attempts to stop critical ICS/OT services using common command-line tools like 'net stop', 'sc stop', or 'taskkill'.
  This activity is a common post-exploitation TTP (MITRE ATT&CK T1489) observed after an adversary has gained access to an OT
  environment, often by exploiting a known vulnerability in vendor software. Stopping these services can be a precursor to
  loading malicious project files, disrupting physical processes, or causing a denial of service.

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrative or maintenance activity by engineers or system administrators. It is critical to correlate these alerts with planned work orders.
  - Automated scripts used for restarting hung services, although these should be investigated to ensure they are authorized.
