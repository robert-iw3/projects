title: AWS AdministratorAccess Policy Attached to an IAM User
id: 6bb7ebe5-07c4-4d82-9363-7b53d2d9e90b
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the attachment of the AWS-managed 'AdministratorAccess' policy to an IAM user. This action grants full administrative privileges over the AWS account and is a critical privilege escalation technique used by attackers to gain complete control after an initial compromise, as seen in the referenced Expel report.

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate creation of a new administrator account by authorized personnel.
  - This alert is high-fidelity for indicating a high-impact change but may be noisy in environments where administrative users are frequently created. It should be correlated with other signals like the user being newly created or the action originating from an unusual source.
