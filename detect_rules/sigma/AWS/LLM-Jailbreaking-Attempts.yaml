title: AWS Bedrock Potential Jailbreak or Illicit Content Generation Attempt
id: 2ba26826-b8f7-4288-863e-a0b5067bbfba
status: experimental
description: |-
  Detects keywords associated with jailbreaking techniques or illicit content generation within AWS Bedrock invocation logs. This activity is indicative of attempts to bypass model safety filters to generate content that violates acceptable use policies, often seen in LLM hijacking campaigns.
  **Note:** This detection requires that AWS Bedrock model invocation logging is enabled and the resulting logs (from S3 or CloudWatch) are ingested into the SIEM. The keywords should be checked against the prompt and system message fields.

  keywords:
        # These keywords are derived from observed attacker prompts and common jailbreaking techniques.
        # They should be checked against the content of the prompt sent to the model.

  condition: keywords
fields:
  - requestBody.system   # Field where system-level instructions/jailbreaks are often placed.
  - requestBody.input.messages.content   # Field containing the user's prompt.
  - prompt   # Generic field for prompt content.
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate research into AI model safety and security.
  - Fictional writing or other approved use cases that may touch upon these themes.
  - This rule is highly dependent on the organization's acceptable use policy for LLMs and may require significant tuning and addition of more context to reduce false positives.
