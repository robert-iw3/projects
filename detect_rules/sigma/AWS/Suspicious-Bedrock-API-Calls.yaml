title: AWS Bedrock API Call from Long-Lived Access Key
id: 19865f34-feaa-4bc3-9a87-df7f33ea7bff
status: experimental
description: Detects when a long-lived AWS access key (AKIA) is used to make Bedrock API calls that are typically associated with the AWS Management Console. This can be an indicator of LLM hijacking, where an attacker with a compromised key attempts to enable or configure models for abuse.

  - Legitimate administrative scripts or third-party tools might use these APIs, although it is uncommon. Tuning may be required to exclude known-good automation user ARNs or source IP addresses.
