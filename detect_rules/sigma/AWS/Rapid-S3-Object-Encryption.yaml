title: High Volume of S3 Object Modifications by a Single User
id: f0d65d4d-4201-4137-9b65-5498d32fcfef
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects a high volume of S3 object modification or deletion events (PutObject, CopyObject, DeleteObject, DeleteObjectVersion) performed by a single user identity on a single bucket within a short time frame. This could indicate an S3 ransomware attack where an attacker is rapidly encrypting or deleting objects in a bucket.

detection:
  # Detects key S3 object modification and deletion events
  selection:
    eventName:
      - 'CopyObject'
      - 'DeleteObject'
      - 'DeleteObjectVersion'
      - 'PutObject'
  # Correlates events by user and target bucket over a short time window
  # The condition counts if a single user performs more than 100 actions on a single bucket in 10 minutes.
  # This threshold is a starting point and may need tuning based on your environment's baseline activity.
  aggregation:
    group-by:
      - userIdentity.arn
      - requestParameters.bucketName
    timespan: 10m
    condition: count() > 100
  condition: selection and aggregation
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate high-volume data operations, such as application logging, data pipeline jobs, or large data migrations.
  - The threshold for the event count will likely need to be tuned based on normal activity within the environment to reduce noise.
