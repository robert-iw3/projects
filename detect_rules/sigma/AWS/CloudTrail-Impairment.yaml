    - Legitimate administrative actions to reconfigure or decommission CloudTrail trails. The `UpdateTrail` event can be common during normal operations. To reduce noise, consider creating more specific rules for `UpdateTrail` that look for changes like disabling multi-region support (`requestParameters.isMultiRegionTrail: false`) or log file validation (`requestParameters.enableLogFileValidation: false`).
