title: High Volume of S3 Read Operations by a Single Identity
id: 3bff7b07-07de-4492-b2cb-3108d40dd723
status: experimental
description: Detects a high volume of S3 read operations (ListObjects, HeadObject, GetObject) initiated by a single AWS identity within a short timeframe. This pattern can indicate data enumeration and exfiltration attempts by an attacker who has gained access to credentials.

  # The condition aggregates the count of S3 read events by the user's principal ID.
  # A high count is suspicious and may indicate automated data discovery or theft.
  condition: selection | count() by aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.principal_id > 100
  timeframe: 1h
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate data-intensive applications, backup services, or data analytics platforms may generate a high volume of S3 read events.
  - It is recommended to tune the threshold (e.g., > 100) based on your environment's baseline activity.
  - Consider excluding known service accounts, roles, or user agents associated with legitimate automated processes.
