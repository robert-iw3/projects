title: Static Tundra Group Activity
id: f897bc86-b652-4a6a-bd8a-2a725a6fca72
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects a combination of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) associated with the Russian state-sponsored group Static Tundra.
  This includes network communications to known C2 IPs, network device configuration changes, and data exfiltration techniques observed on network devices like Cisco routers.

  # It is intended to be run against logs from network devices like Cisco routers, but network IOCs may appear in other log sources.

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrative activity may use TFTP or GRE tunnels. It is recommended to baseline normal activity and focus on traffic to/from network infrastructure zones.
  - Access-list (ACL) and TACACS+ configuration changes can be legitimate. Correlate these events with change management records or authorized administrator activity.
