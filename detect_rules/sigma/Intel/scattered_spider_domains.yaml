title: Scattered Spider Phishing Domain Patterns
id: 738fd52a-bbb8-499b-a4be-f53d04c70481
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects network connections to domains matching patterns commonly used by the Scattered Spider threat group for phishing campaigns.
  The group often registers domains that mimic legitimate corporate services by appending suffixes like "-sso", "-servicedesk", "-okta", "-vpn", or "-helpdesk" to a target's name (e.g., victim-sso.com).

falsepositives:
  - Legitimate third-party services or even internal services could potentially
    use similar domain naming conventions. It is recommended to baseline your
    environment and add exceptions for known-good domains that match these
    patterns.
