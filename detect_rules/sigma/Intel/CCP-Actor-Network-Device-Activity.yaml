  condition: 1 of them
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate administrative activity on network devices may trigger the 'selection_log' keywords.
  - The high-port SSH pattern ('xxx22') in 'selection_net_pattern' may be noisy and could match legitimate services. It is recommended to baseline normal activity and filter known good source or destination IPs.
