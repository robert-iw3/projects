  condition: 1 of them
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate scripts that use PowerShell for string manipulation or command
    chaining
  - although the specific combination of indicators in this rule is highly
    suspicious.
  - Network infrastructure changes by the threat actor
  - rendering the network IOCs (konamo.xyz
  - raedom.store
  - etc.) outdated.
