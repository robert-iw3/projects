title: Godzilla Webshell POST to Unusual ASPX Route
id: ee53f076-0d61-4c45-af43-aa3241e5dbce
status: experimental
description: Detects POST requests to ASP.NET pages (.aspx) that may indicate interaction with a Godzilla webshell. Attackers often use POST requests to rarely used or custom .aspx pages for command and control. This detection is broad and should be correlated with other indicators.

  condition: selection and not filter_known_good
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate web applications frequently use POST requests to .aspx pages for normal functionality (e.g., submitting forms).
  - This rule is intended as a starting point for threat hunting and will likely require significant tuning.
  - To reduce false positives, populate the `filter_known_good` section with pages that are expected to receive POST requests in your environment.
  - Correlate alerts from this rule with other suspicious activity on the host, such as the IIS worker process (w3wp.exe) spawning child processes or loading unusual CLR modules.
