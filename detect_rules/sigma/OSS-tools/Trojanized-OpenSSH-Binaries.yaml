title: Trojanized OpenSSH ShieldSlide Variant
id: 12b3a9b8-3781-4542-ad49-2fa27d482ba4
status: experimental
description: >-
  Detects potential execution of a trojanized OpenSSH binary, similar to the ShieldSlide tool used by the threat actor GLACIAL PANDA.
  This detection identifies the sshd process running from a non-standard path or the sshd process spawning suspicious child processes commonly used for C2 or data exfiltration.
